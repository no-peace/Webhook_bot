```example
# cloudflared configuration — locally-managed tunnel.
#
# Copy to `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` (or /etc/cloudflared/config.yml) and fill in
# the UUID printed by `cloudflared tunnel create dmb`.
#
# Why this exists: a Pterodactyl container is only allocated one or two ports, so
# you cannot bind both the SPA and the API to public ports. `cloudflared` makes
# *outbound* connections to Cloudflare's edge and carries traffic back down them,
# so nothing has to be exposed inbound at all.

# Rules are evaluated top to bottom; the first match wins.
# Cloudflare forwards the full path unmodified, and every API route already
# lives under `/api`, so one hostname can serve both the site and the API.
ingress:
  # 1. API requests -> Express on 3001. Must come BEFORE the catch-all, because
  #    a rule without `path` matches every path.
  - hostname: builder.example.com
    path: ^/api
    service: http://localhost:3001

  # 2. Everything else -> the built SPA (Vite preview / nginx / `pm2 dmb-web`).
  - hostname: builder.example.com
    service: http://localhost:5173

  # ── Alternative: one subdomain per service ────────────────────────────────
  # Handy when you want different Cloudflare Access / cache policies for the
  # site and the API. If you use this, set VITE_API_BASE_URL to the API hostname
  # and add that hostname to CLIENT_ORIGIN on the server.
  #
  # - hostname: api.builder.example.com
  #   service: http://localhost:3001
  # - hostname: builder.example.com
  #   service: http://localhost:5173

  # Required catch-all. Without it cloudflared refuses to start.
  - service: http_status:404
