 * Shared Discord constants.

 * Declared with `as const` so every value keeps its literal type. That means a
 * component built with `ComponentType.Container` is typed as `17`, not `number`,
 * which lets the compiler catch a mismatched component wherever the tree is
 * walked.
 *
 * This package has no runtime dependencies and is imported by both the Vite
 * client and the Express server.
